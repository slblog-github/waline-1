## Development

- Run `npm run client:dev` to start `@waline/client` devServer

  ::: tip

  Since waline is based on Client/Server architecture, when debugging a client, you need to set `SERVERURL`, or start server devServer below at the same time and use the default `localhost:9090`.

  :::

- Run `npm run server:dev` to start `@waline/server` devServer

  ::: tip

  In order to run `@waline/server` locally, you need to configure some local environment variables to `example/.env`.

  We provide an exmple for you in `example/.env.example`.
